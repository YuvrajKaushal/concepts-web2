<h2>Tools you will want</h2>
Keep in mind this is just my opinion, if you want to use other tools,
feel free.
<ul>
<li>Python's BaseHTTPServer: You can use a full blown webserver, but I really like creating my own webserver in just a few lines of code.</li>
<li>A firefox plugin to manipulate cookies</li>
<li>A javascript framework like Jquery to simplify HTTP requests.</li>
<li>Perl or Python scripts to create HTTP requests. Use whichever language you like better.</li>
<li>Netcat (the nc command in linux) to play with the basic TCP level of HTTP requests.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cross Site Scripting Attack</h2>
A cross site scripting (XSS) attack happens when 
a site does not validate input from a user and a user is
able to inject Javascript into the page.  When the user can inject
javascript, he/she can force another users computer to execute that
javascript without them knowing.  This technique can be used to steal 
a cookie by forcing a request to a 3rd party server and appending the
cookie value on the the end of the request. (This is just one example
of the kinds of things XSS allows.)

<h2>SQL Injection</h2>
<p>
SQL is the language used to pull data in most web applications.  Consider the following example:
<pre>
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username' AND password = '$pass'
</pre>
suppose in this example, $username and $pass are variables that are 
taken directly from user's input without any validation. Now, if a 
user was clever, they would enter a password like:
<pre>' OR 1=1--</pre>
(the -- is a comment block in SQL) and the query will become:
<pre>
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'mal' AND password = '' OR 1=1--'
</pre>
and since 1 always = 1, for any row, every row is returned and depending
on the rest of the code, the bad guy may become the first user in the 
database.  If the bad guy was more evil, his password might be:
<pre>
'; DROP DATABASE;--
</pre>
and I think it's clear what the effects are.

<h2>Session Hijacking</h2>
HTTP is by nature a stateless protocol.  This means that
in order to simulate state, there must be some mechanism for
the HTTP server to know who the user is.  The solution is called
a "session."  Typically, the browser stores a cookie which 
contains a unique ID to associate that user with their session.
</p>
<p>
At this point, I hope you are wondering, "but what if I can figure 
out the unique id in that cookie?"  Yes, you can do this.  And yes, 
you will become them, as far as the website is concerned.</p>
<p>
On a good website, the cookie is only allowed to be transmitted over a 
secure HTTPS connection, and a packet sniffer would be unable to 
force a request that would expose the cookie.  Also on a good website, 
the unique ID would be different every time the user logs in, so that
if the cookie was stolen once, the attacker would only have the session
for a limited amount of time.  A lot of websites ignore these best 
practices.

In Javascript, you can access the cookies on a webpage from the 
"document.cookie" variable.  Keep in mind the browser is only going
to show the cookies of the website you are on, this is a basic
security feature.  So in order to  programmatically access some users
cookies you must be able to inject your code onto their page.

<h2>Cross Site Forgery Request</h2>
<p>
Cross site forgery request (CSRF, or C-SURF, or Session Surfing) 
attacks are often similar to XSS attacks in practice (many attacks are a little
of both, and often it's difficult to classify them as one or another).
The very basic idea in a CSRF attack is to force a user's browser
to make a request to a site he/she is already logged into.  The web 
server then runs the script as if the user knowingly made the request.
</p>
<p>
CAPTCHA are a way many sites try to prevent this.  In order to fake 
the request from the user, the script would have to get the 
CAPTCHA challenge correct.

<h2>Creating an HTTP Request</h2>
<p>
<h3>In Python:</h3>
<pre>
import urllib2

getRequest = urllib2.urlopen("http://anything.com")
print getRequest.read()
print getRequest.info()

postRequest = urllib2.urlopen("http://anything.com/login.php","user=me&pass=iluvbears")
</pre>
<p>To do more complicated requests, you may need to create a urllib2.Request object.  The Python docs are pretty good. Check them out.
</p>
<h3>In Perl:</h3>
<pre>
use URI;
my $url = URI->new('http://somesite.com/search');
$url->query_form(
  'title'     => 'Kittens',
  'type'      => 'Posters',
);

</pre>
<p>
Just google Perl HTTP, the first result is a great tutorial that demonstrates POST requests, saving cookies, changing user agent string, way too much for me to go over.
</p>
<h3>In Javascript*:</h3>
<pre>
var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
req.open("GET","somelocalpage.php?search=waldo&results=15",true);
req.send(null);
</pre>
<p>
*Modern browsers obey the "same origin policy" which prevents web 
pages from making certain types of requests to other domains.  
If you want to make a request from a domain that is different from 
the webpage your script is hosted on, you'll need to be a little 
more clever (hint: think about the type of content the web allows cross-domain access to).
</p>
<p>
A post request in javascript is also slightly more complex; instead of sending null on the 3rd line, you send that data in the form of key1=value1&key2=value2... Keep in mind this method only works in non-IE browsers.  For easier POSTing and more browser support check out a javascript framework like jQuery.

<h2>Running an HTTP Server</h2>
<p>
Using Python's BaseHTTPServer
<pre>
import BaseHTTPServer

class Dispatcher(BaseHTTPServer.BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        if self.path == "/redirect":
            self.send_response(301)
            self.wfile.write("Location: http://www.google.com")
            self.end_headers()
        elif self.path == "/sayhello":
            self.send_request(200)
            self.end_headers()
            self.wfile.write("Hello world")
        else:
            print self.path
    def do_POST(self):
        pass
port = 7688
server = BaseHTTPServer.HTTPServer(('',port),Dispatcher)
server.serve_forever()
</pre>
In this simple example, we have a web server running on port 7688. If you 
navtiaged your browser to http://localhost:7688/redirect it would redirect you to Google,
and if you navigated to http://localhost:7688/sayhello you would be greeted by a simple web page that prints "Hello World".
<p>
In practice, you can combine these basic features with python's regular
expression package and have a very dynamic web server. You can also write files to self.wfile just like it was an file on your computer; this is how you return files with a custom python webserver.
</p>

<h2>Expanding this document</h2>
<p>
When taking notes for your team, you should include documentation similar to this, so that we can build this up to a comprehensive tutorial.  I didn't cover a lot of things on purpose; I don't want to make this too easy.  As stated in the rules, the team with the best documentation gets extra points!
