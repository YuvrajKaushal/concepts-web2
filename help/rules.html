<b>Points:</b> For your team to earn points, you must complete the challenged listed on the main page.  Each challenge starts at a point value and goes up 1 point every minute it is left unclaimed. Every hint takes off 30 points from the challenge.
</p>

<p>
<b>Hints:</b>
After 30 minutes have passed, teams may decide to request a hint on the challenge.  Once both teams have requested a hint on this specific challenge, a hint will be given via the webpage.  Keep in mind, this takes away points from the award.
</p>

<p>
<b>Taking notes:</b>
Each team is encouraged to take notes via the main web page.  The other team will not have access to your notes and the team with the most useful docmentation of their process will be awarded an additional 50 points.
</p>

<p>
<b>Tutorials:</b>
To learn more about how to take advantage of vulnerablities, a <a href="tutorials.html">tutorial page</a> has been setup.  You are also encouraged to research these topic over the internet.
</p>
<p>
<b>Difficulty</b>
I don't know how difficult these challenges will be.  I hope they are not very easy.  I spent a lot of time isolating the security flaws on each site; in other words, most of the sites have just 1 main vulnerability that I put in on purpose.  But, if you find something I didn't know about, that is awesome and I encourage you to try for that.
</p>
<p>
<b>Disclaimers:</b>
Do NOT use real passwords for your fake user accounts you will be creating.  An MD5 of your password is stored in my database and I don't really want to have that.  So just use easy to remember passwords that you can share with your team.
